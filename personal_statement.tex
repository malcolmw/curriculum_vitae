\begin{rSection}{Personal Statement}
    My research interests span the spectrum of computational methods in seismology---from observational problems, like elastic-wave-phase detection; to forward problems, like modeling propagating wavefronts; and inverse problems, like locating earthquakes---and how to synthesize these to investigate structural and mechanical properties of the Earth's subsurface.
